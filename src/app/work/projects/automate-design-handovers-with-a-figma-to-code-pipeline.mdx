## Overview

This project focused on building an AI-powered chatbot tool for real-time social media monitoring. The goal was to create a system that could analyze user-generated content on platforms like Twitter and Reddit to identify trends, detect sentiment shifts, and provide actionable insights. By using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning, this tool helps businesses understand public opinion and react to emerging issues in real-time.

## Key Features

### Real-Time Data Collection
Developed a data pipeline to scrape and analyze social media posts in real-time, using APIs from platforms like Twitter and Reddit.

### Sentiment Analysis
Built a machine learning model using NLP techniques (BERT and GPT) to classify the sentiment of each post (positive, negative, or neutral) with high accuracy.

### Trend Detection
Implemented algorithms to detect emerging trends by analyzing frequent keywords and hashtags, providing early insights into shifts in public sentiment.

### Actionable Insights Dashboard
Created a user-friendly dashboard that visualizes sentiment trends, helping businesses identify areas for improvement and track customer feedback.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For implementing the NLP models and data processing pipelines.
- **TensorFlow & Hugging Face**: For training and deploying BERT and GPT-based models for sentiment analysis.
- **Twitter & Reddit APIs**: For data collection from social media platforms.
- **Dash**: For building the real-time sentiment analysis dashboard.

## Challenges and Learnings

The primary challenge was ensuring the system could process large volumes of real-time data without latency. Optimizing the sentiment analysis model for accuracy while maintaining speed was crucial. Additionally, handling diverse social media language and slang required continuous fine-tuning of the models to improve their ability to understand context and sentiment.

## Outcome

The sentiment analysis tool provided businesses with valuable insights into customer sentiment, enabling them to proactively respond to public opinion. The tool successfully detected trends and shifts in sentiment in real-time, contributing to improved decision-making and faster reactions to customer feedback.
