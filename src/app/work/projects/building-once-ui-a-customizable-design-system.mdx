## Overview

Development of an AI-powered recommendation system using Python and TensorFlow to provide personalized content suggestions based on user preferences and behavior.

## Key Features

- **Recommendation Engine**: Built a machine learning model using collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to predict and recommend relevant content to users.
- **Real-Time Data Processing**: Implemented real-time user data collection and processing using Apache Kafka and Apache Spark, enabling quick updates to recommendations based on the latest user activity.
- **Personalized Experience**: The recommendation system adapts to user interactions, improving its suggestions over time through continuous learning and model updates.
- **API Integration**: Developed a REST API in Flask to serve recommendations to various applications, ensuring seamless integration with both web and mobile platforms.

## Technologies Used

- **TensorFlow**: For building and training machine learning models.
- **Python**: For implementing data processing, recommendation algorithms, and backend services.
- **Flask**: For building the RESTful API to serve recommendations.
- **Apache Kafka & Spark**: For handling real-time data streaming and processing.

## Challenges and Learnings

One challenge faced was ensuring the scalability of the recommendation system as user data grew. Optimizing the machine learning model and utilizing real-time data processing pipelines were crucial to maintain performance and provide accurate recommendations. Another key learning was fine-tuning the model's parameters to balance between personalization and diversity in recommendations.

## Outcome

The recommendation system significantly increased user engagement and retention, providing more relevant content to users. By continuously improving through real-time data, the system ensures personalized experiences and has become a valuable tool for driving user satisfaction and business growth.
